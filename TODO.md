# TODO: Implement Role-Based Sidebar for Students

- [x] Install jwt-decode package
- [x] Update authSlice.js to decode JWT token and store user role in state
- [x] Update Sidebar.jsx to conditionally render menu based on user role (student vs admin)
- [x] Test the implementation by logging in as student and verifying sidebar shows only student features
